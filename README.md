Project Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning–based cardiovascular risk prediction system using clinical and laboratory data. The task is modeled as a binary classification problem, aiming to identify individuals with a higher likelihood of developing heart disease.

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and includes key medical attributes frequently used in cardiovascular diagnostics. The project emphasizes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model comparison, and performance evaluation using appropriate classification metrics.
